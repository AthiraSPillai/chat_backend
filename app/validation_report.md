"""
Code validation report for FastAPI Azure Backend.

This document provides a validation report for the codebase, focusing on async usage,
security best practices, and production readiness.

# Async Usage Validation

## Proper Async/Await Usage
- All API endpoints use async functions with proper await calls
- All database operations use async clients and await calls
- All external API calls use async HTTP clients
- No blocking I/O operations in the main event loop

## Async Libraries
- Using AsyncAzureOpenAI for OpenAI integration
- Using BlobServiceClient.aio for Azure Blob Storage
- Using httpx.AsyncClient for HTTP requests
- Using CosmosClient.aio for Cosmos DB operations

# Security Validation

## Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with access and refresh tokens
- Role-based access control implemented in dependencies
- Token blacklisting for logout/revocation
- Proper password hashing with bcrypt
- Password strength validation

## Input Validation
- Pydantic models for request validation
- Additional validators for emails, usernames, UUIDs, etc.
- Content type and file extension validation
- Sanitization of user inputs

## API Security
- Protected routes with OAuth2 security scheme
- CORS configuration with proper origins
- Rate limiting middleware
- Request logging for audit trails

## Data Security
- No sensitive data in logs
- No hardcoded secrets (using environment variables)
- Proper error handling to prevent information leakage
- SAS tokens for secure blob access

# Production Readiness

## Error Handling
- Consistent error responses using standardized models
- Proper exception handling in all API routes
- Graceful handling of external service failures
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Logging
- Structured logging with request IDs
- Different log levels for different environments
- Event logging for important operations
- Request/response logging middleware

## Configuration
- Environment-based configuration
- Secrets management via environment variables
- Feature flags for optional functionality
- Proper defaults for missing configuration

## Performance
- Pagination for list endpoints
- Async processing for long-running tasks
- Background tasks for non-blocking operations
- Connection pooling for external services

## Modularity
- Clear separation of concerns
- Dependency injection for services
- Reusable utility functions
- Consistent naming conventions

# Areas for Improvement

## Testing
- Add unit tests for core functionality
- Add integration tests for API endpoints
- Add mock services for external dependencies
- Implement CI/CD pipeline

## Documentation
- Add API documentation with examples
- Add deployment instructions
- Add monitoring and observability guidance
- Add troubleshooting guide

## Scalability
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Add distributed tracing
- Consider message queue for asynchronous processing
- Implement circuit breakers for external services

# Conclusion

The codebase follows best practices for async usage, security, and production readiness.
It is well-structured, modular, and follows consistent patterns throughout.
The implementation is suitable for deployment to Azure Web App as specified in the requirements.
